QuartzComposerExperiments
=========================

some experiments in Quartz Composer

1) grid strecthing.qtz

A grid of randomly coloured squares is rendered and a distortion is applied to strech and squeeze the grid.

2) matrix.qtz

A more complex example using Javascript in Quartz Composer to create a visual inspired by the movie.

These are compostions are provided as examples;  they are by no means complete work & are not definitely not suitable for use in any commercial way.  You are free to use them in your work - you will need to debug the code.
